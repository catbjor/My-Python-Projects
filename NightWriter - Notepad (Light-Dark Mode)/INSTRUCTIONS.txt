This notepad comes with a section to save and view saved files. 

Instructions for Setting Up File Path:

Before running this application, please make sure that you set your file path where the 'saved_files.txt' file should be located. 
The program will look for the 'saved_files.txt' file to load and save the list of files you've worked with.

If you want to customize the file location, you need to adjust the code accordingly.
    1. Open the code in a Python editor.
    2. Look for the following section in the code:



    def save_file_list(self):
        with open("saved_files.txt", "w") as f:
            ...

    def load_file_list(self):
        if os.path.exists("saved_files.txt"):
            with open("saved_files.txt", "r") as f:
                ...



- Replace `"saved_files.txt"` with the full file path you want to use. For example:
  
    def save_file_list(self):
        with open("C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents/saved_files.txt", "w") as f:
            ...

- You can change the path to any location you prefer. 

Make sure the path exists before running the program.

Enjoy using NightWriter!:)
